    "The New York City subway is huge in terms of the number of subway reail cars.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The MTA network has the nationâ€™s largest bus fleet and more subway and commuter rail cars than all other U.S. transit systems combined [[1]](#footnote_1)\n",
    "\n",
    "I live in New York City, and am exposed to the benefits of this extensive, 24 hour system, as well as the inconveniences of unexpected train delays.\n",
    "Unfortunately, with a 24 hour subway system, using aging signal systems, in some cases from the 1930's, there are many delays[2]. Additionally, as ridership has increased over the years, crowding can simply cause delays.[3](#footnote_3) Now, there are estimated train arrival times available on train platforms[[4]](#footnote_4), however, from personal experience, these generally don't work well when there are delays."

    ">When there is a delay, how long can I expect to wait until the next train?\n",
    "\n",
    "In my experience, the displayed expected arrival times, when available, become unreliable when there is a delay, or in some cases stop providing estimated arrival times, and instead just announce \"Delay\" instead of the usual \"N minutes\".  I want to answer the question of \"What does this delay mean for the arrival time of the next train?\".  More precisely stated, \"Given that a delay has been announced by the MTA within the last hour, when will the next train come to the train platform I am waiting on?\"\n"

    "\n",
    "I propose using a supervised machine learning approach to provide an estimate of minutes until a next train arrives following the departure of the previous train.  This estimate can easily be compared to actual train arrival times in order to quantify performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to provide appropriate scope, limiting project risk and providing proof of concept, the proposed deliverable is an estimator that provides real-time predicted wait time until next train for the Northbound platform at Times Square 42nd St. on the NYC N line[[5]](#footnote_5) when there are announced delays.  This will be deployed to AWS Sagemaker with a web-app front-end in order to access relevant predictions within the current minute.  It is expected there will be a clear roadmap for future work to extend the model to platforms and trains upon completion of this project.\n"

These datasets include sub-minutely information on current train location and scheduled arrival times, as well as timestamped status alerts for delays.  There are equivalent realtime feeds also available from the MTA for use in the deployed realtime system.\n",

The proposed metric for evaluating overall model performance and performance of the benchmark is $RMSE$.  $RMSE$ will be helpful, as it will provide errors in units of the predicted variable, as it takes the square root of the $MSE$ metric[[6]](#footnote_6).  In this particular case, the $RMSE$ metric will be in units of minutes, this is much easier to think about and provides a more meaningful metric in this case.\n",

In short, spending time up-front developing an over-engineered infrastructure is useless if the data is unusable, or the model is not performant.  For ease of development and cost reduction, initial data exploration and model development will be performed on a local workstation.  With this in mind, the system can easily be migrated to AWS Sagemaker using the artifacts from a locally trained model."
